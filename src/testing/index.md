Unfortunately, I do not have any screenshots or saved code. However, since I used GitHub for all of my code, you may look through the [**commit log**](https://github.com/Stefanuk12/EasyPasswords/commits/main).

## How to use the commit log
Each entry within the commit log is called a "commit". 

- Pressing on the commit title brings up a page which shows all of the changes. There is also a comments section which may include any extended explanations.
- Pressing on the `< >` button next to a commit shows all of the code as it would've have been at that point in time.
