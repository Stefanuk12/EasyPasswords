## The Programing Language
I will be using TypeScript.

## Why TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so in the end it is JavaScript - with types, and other features.

This means not only is it cross-platform, but also performant, and can be made into a web application easily through the use of React.

While I could use Python, I decided not to due to the reasons stated above, and I am not as experienced with it. In addition, Python's syntax and underlying architecture is not the best.

Some may argue I could use the C family, and while I could, it may be too sophisticated for such a simple task.
